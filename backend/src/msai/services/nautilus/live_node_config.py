"""Phase 1 live ``TradingNodeConfig`` builder.

Constructs the Nautilus ``TradingNodeConfig`` that the live trading
subprocess hands to ``TradingNode``. Uses Nautilus natives for every
engine and client config so we get reconciliation, risk checks, and IB
integration "for free" (decision: don't reinvent what Nautilus already
provides — see the natives audit).

Phase 1 deliberately leaves a few things at default that later phases
fill in:

- ``cache.database`` and ``message_bus.database`` stay None — Phase 3
  task 3.2 wires Redis as the durable backend. Phase 1 runs in-memory.
- ``load_state`` and ``save_state`` are False — Phase 4 task 4.5
  enables them once the persistence path has been smoke-tested.
- ``message_bus`` does not yet pin a stream name — Phase 3 task 3.2
  sets ``stream_per_topic=False`` and the deployment-specific stream.

Two Nautilus gotchas drive the IB client wiring:

- **Gotcha #3** — two ``TradingNode`` clients on the same IB Gateway
  with the same ``ibg_client_id`` silently disconnect each other. Each
  deployment gets a unique data-client id AND a unique exec-client id,
  derived deterministically from its ``deployment_id`` UUID so a restart
  reuses the SAME ids (otherwise IB Gateway sees a "new" client and
  the old one's open orders / subscriptions get stranded).
- **Gotcha #6** — port 4002 (paper) with a live account_id (or 4001 +
  paper account) is a silent data-flow killer: IB Gateway accepts the
  connection but provides no data. Validated at config-build time.

    """Build a ``TradingNodeConfig`` for a multi-strategy portfolio deployment.

    Like :func:`build_live_trading_node_config` but accepts N strategy
    members instead of one, building N ``ImportableStrategyConfig`` objects
    that share a SINGLE IB exec/data client and a single instrument
    provider covering ALL members' instruments.

    Key differences from the single-strategy builder:

    - ``strategies`` is a list of length N (one per member)
    - ``load_state=True, save_state=True`` always — critical for warm
      restart of the portfolio
    - Instruments are aggregated across ALL members for the provider config
    - Each strategy's ``order_id_tag`` uses ``strategy_id_full`` (not the
      deployment_slug) so orders are attributable to individual strategies

    Args:
        deployment_slug: 16-char hex slug. Drives trader_id and IB client ids.
        strategy_members: One or more strategy payloads. Must be non-empty.
        ib_settings: IB Gateway connection + account settings.
        max_notional_per_order: Per-instrument cap on order notional value.
        max_order_submit_rate: Nautilus rate limit for order submissions.
        max_order_modify_rate: Nautilus rate limit for order modifications.
        spawn_today: Exchange-local date for front-month futures resolution.

    Returns:
        A fully populated ``TradingNodeConfig`` ready for ``TradingNode``.

    Raises:
        ValueError: For empty ``strategy_members``, no instruments across
            all members, unknown port, or port/account mismatch.
