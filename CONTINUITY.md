## Goal

First real backtest — ingest market data and run EMA Cross strategy on real AAPL/SPY data.

## Done

- Hybrid merge PR#3 merged (2026-04-13): 18 tasks, 99 files, ~15K lines
- Docker Compose parity PR#4 merged (2026-04-13): 12 gaps fixed, all 10 containers running
- IB Gateway connected: 6 paper sub-accounts verified (DFP733210 + DUP733211-215, ~$1M each)
- Databento API key configured
- Phase 2 parity backlog cleared 2026-04-15: PR #6 portfolio, #7 playwright e2e, #8 CLI sub-apps, #9 QuantStats intraday, #10 alerting API, #11 daily scheduler tz — all merged after local merge-main-into-branch conflict resolution (1147 tests on final branch)
- Phase 2 #4 council (5 advisors + chairman): rejected verbatim Option A (867 LOC) and framed Option B (300 LOC); mandated paper-IB kill-all drill as go/no-go gate
- Phase 2 #4 drill executed (2026-04-15 04:00 UTC): exposed 3 P0 live-stack bugs blocking any `/live/start` (profile-gate, supervisor silent-fail, IB host/port drift)
- Phase 2 #4 — live trade persistence merged (PR #15): broker_trade_id column + partial unique dedup + ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING path from OrderFilled → trades; audit row mismatch now visible (Codex review P1+P2 both addressed)
- Live-stack kill-all drill PASSED 2026-04-15 05:37: EUR/USD.IDEALPRO paper BUY filled → /kill-all → SELL reduce_only filled → PositionClosed in 187 ms. Layer 3 (SIGTERM + manage_stop=True) verified.
- Live-stack sprint complete 2026-04-15 06:00 UTC — all 3 P0s fixed in separate branches ready for PR+merge:
  - P0-B `fix/live-supervisor-silent-spawn-fail` (f324f0c): LiveCommandBus.\_publish now calls ensure_group before xadd so commands don't vanish when consumer group is positioned at `$`; supervisor **main**.py configures stdlib logging.basicConfig so its logs are visible in docker logs
  - P0-C `fix/ib-gateway-env-var-drift` (6f02767): settings.ib_host/ib_port accept AliasChoices on IB_GATEWAY_HOST + IB_GATEWAY_PORT_PAPER env names
  - P0-A `fix/live-supervisor-default-profile` (08b34a9): /live/start returns 503 fast when no supervisor consumer is registered (vs silent 504 timeout)

## Now

All open PRs closed (Phase 2 #1-#4 + portfolio/playwright/CLI ports). Main has everything. Moving to the stated goal: first real backtest with real AAPL/SPY data via Databento.

## Next

1. **First real backtest** — ingest AAPL + SPY minute bars (Databento, 2024-01-01 → 2025-01-01), run EMA Cross, verify UI + QuantStats report. End-to-end validation.
2. Apply migration `k9e0f1g2h3i4_add_broker_trade_id_to_trades` to dev Postgres.
3. Phase 2 #5 Strategy registry + continuous futures (DB-backed InstrumentDefinition, `.Z.` regex).
4. Follow-ups (not blocking): `READ_ONLY_API=no` compose default; `/account/health` probe never-started bug; `/live/positions` gap; deployment row status stays `starting`; audit lifecycle race auto-heal.
